# RL Maze Solver Project - Development Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Maze Solver with Reinforcement Learning (RL) using Reward Shaping** project, developed as part of the **Advanced Topics on Intelligent Systems** course at **FEUP (Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto)**. The project focuses on training an AI agent to solve a maze using RL techniques, with an emphasis on reward shaping to improve learning efficiency.

## Key Features

### 1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - The AI agent learns to navigate the maze by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards based on its actions.
   - The agent uses the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm, a state-of-the-art RL algorithm, to optimize its policy.

### 2. **Reward Shaping**
   - Reward shaping is implemented to guide the agent towards desirable behaviors by modifying the reward function.
   - For example, the agent receives higher rewards for moving closer to the goal and penalties for moving away or hitting obstacles.

### 3. **Unity Environment**
   - The maze environment is built using Unity, providing a flexible and interactive platform for training and testing the RL agent.
   - The environment includes multiple scenes with varying maze layouts to test the agent's generalization capabilities.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Unity Hub** and **Unity Editor** (version 2021.3 or later recommended).
- **Python** (optional, for running custom RL training scripts).
- **ML-Agents Toolkit**: Required for PPO implementation and training.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brumocas/RL_Project.git
   cd RL_Project
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Unity**:
   - Launch Unity Hub and open the `RL_Project` folder as a new project.
   - Ensure all dependencies are imported correctly.

3. **Set Up ML-Agents Toolkit**:
   - Install the ML-Agents Toolkit by following the official [installation guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_20_docs/docs/Installation.md).
   - Ensure the PPO algorithm is configured in the `TrainerConfig.yaml` file.

4. **Train the Agent**:
   - Use the ML-Agents CLI to train the agent:
     ```bash
     mlagents-learn config/TrainerConfig.yaml --run-id=maze_solver_ppo
     ```
   - Monitor training progress using TensorBoard.

5. **Run the Game**:
   - Open the desired scene from the `Assets/Scenes/` folder (e.g., `Menu.unity`).
   - Click the **Play** button in the Unity Editor to start the game.

6. **Build the Executable** (Optional):
   - Go to `File > Build Settings`.
   - Select the target platform (Linux, Mac, or Windows).
   - Click **Build** and choose the output directory.
