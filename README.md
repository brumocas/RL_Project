# RL Maze Solver Project - Development Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Maze Solver with Reinforcement Learning (RL) using Reward Shaping** project, developed as part of the **Advanced Topics on Intelligent Systems** course at **FEUP (Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto)**. The project focuses on training an AI agent to solve a maze using RL techniques, with an emphasis on reward shaping to improve learning efficiency.

## Key Features

### 1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - The AI agent learns to navigate the maze by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards based on its actions.

### 2. **Reward Shaping**
   - Reward shaping is implemented to guide the agent towards desirable behaviors by modifying the reward function.
   - For example, the agent receives higher rewards for moving closer to the goal and penalties for moving away or hitting obstacles.

### 3. **Unity Environment**
   - The maze environment is built using Unity, providing a flexible and interactive platform for training and testing the RL agent.
   - The environment includes multiple scenes with varying maze layouts to test the agent's generalization capabilities.
